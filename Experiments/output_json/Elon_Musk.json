And that's just really an extremely difficult problem. In fact, I think it's an impossible problem without the advent of consciousness. So consciousness is a necessary precursor for that.QUOTES TAKEN FROM TRANSCRIPT ON THE LINK PROVIDED: http://www.oninnovation.com/topics/detail.aspx?playlist=1421&title=Elon%20Musk (Click on the tenth video titled \"Going to Mars\") There are 22 videos all together.  Just because you don't  believe in a \"master intelligence\" does not necessarily make you an atheist, see Pantheism for example.  What has evolution got to do with anything? Many Christians accept the fact evolution happens, evolution says absolutely nothing about god and it has no bearing on the question unless you believe rigidly that everything in the Old Testament is \"fact\".Your assumptions are based quite squarely on Christian (and a minority of it at that) concepts of religion.  Btw I'm not commenting either way on his religion or lack thereof, just that these quotes don't prove anything, certainly not enough for it not to be considered original research. ",

Again you are making assumptions based on purposefully limited interpretations of theology.  There is not a single quote you mention that for certain means he is an atheist.

They met with Lotus and had 3 employees by Jan 2004, and a complete business plan in Feb, all before April of 2004 when Elon Musk led the Series A funding and they finally reached the 5 employees considered \"co-founders.\" It seems to me that those incorporation documents might shed some light on the significance of those 10 months before Musk.

To me, it smacks of credentialism to worry about what specific degrees one holds before using the term \"engineer\".  Moreover, it would violate WP:NPOV to pull it out of Wikipedia, despite what some labor organizations of \"engineers\" might like.  Now, if the article were to declare that Musk is a Professional Engineer, a specific credential\u2014and in the United States, a State-issued license\u2014then that would be an unverified claim and something we should not assert in Wikipedia.

However I will here make just one additional point.  The engineering process consists of many phases, each dealing at different levels of abstraction to the final technology product that utilizes the basic scientific characteristics of materials, chemical components, electronics, software, etc.  For example, early in my engineering career, I did mostly detailed design and detailed \"implemention\" (drawings, flow charts, code, etc.).  A few years later, with more experience, I did more high-level design of larger subassemblies involving the work of multiple engineers.  Later yet, I did even higher-level design, or product \"architecture\", and much less of the sub-component-level and component-level design and \"implementation\".  Later, as a development engineering manager, I did only architecture, and also a critically important piece of work that is a yet higher level of abstraction:  product requirements, and even \"business requirements\" (less geeky:  how is the technology solution going to solve a \"business\" problem, not just the technical stuff like how much speed, or thoughput, or technical bells and whistles we can put on the product).  I maintain that at each of these phases of my career, and my contributions to the projects I was on, I was practicing engineering.  I believe the situation is exactly analogous with Elon Musk:  he has no doubt always done much more \"requirements engineering\" and \"product architecture\", or \"high-level design\" -- even while perhaps doing no stress analysis or battery design.  This is all engineering.  Hope this additional perspective is helpful.  ",

Even considerding the argument of Credentialism and saying a degree is not required to be an Engineer, Elon Musk is still not an Engineer. His profession is not one of Engineering, and being called one has requirements. Webster's defines Engineering as \"a person who is trained in or follows as a profession a branch of engineering\" neither of which fit Elon Musk. The Engineering article on Wikipedia also presents several definitions, but Elon\u2019s involvement is not low level enough to meet the definitions of Engineering. Someone with a high level idea does not always have the knowledge to make the idea become a reality and you would not call them an Engineer; perhaps a businessperson, inventor, or investor, but never Engineer.Sometimes touching the line of a topic of Engineering does not make someone an engineer just like using a meat thermometer everyday as a professional chef would not make someone also a meteorologist.Nor is his current level of involvement one that would warrant the title of Engineer. Though a project has many levels as mentioned above, it does not mean each level requires an engineer or warrants them to be titled Engineer. Those doing the design and their managers are obviously doing engineering. Each level above those levels the technical knowledge decreases and you move into management. Keeping project on target, on budget, and settling arguments between teams is not engineering. With Elon being at the top, there is some technical knowledge required, but its like the knowledge the president of Bunny Bread has about baking. He knows what he needs to know to manage and make business decisions. It is not engineering; it is management. Elon is doing high-level design (think Architect), feature design (think marketing), and management (think MBA), but none of these qualify him an Engineer.At what point do you call a fabricator an Engineer? There are many better examples in the industrial world, but when would someone like Paul Teutul, Sr. ever be called an Engineer? The work he does can be and is done by engineers. At what point would you call an Architect an Engineer? They do high level design, product requirements, and feature specification? Marketing departments commonly have product requirements, but it is marketing, not engineering.More so, the work Tesla Motors and Space X does would require Licensed Engineers, which Elon Musk is not so he would not partake in that work. Having a good product idea and vision of what you want in your product does not make you an Engineer. Elon is not an Engineer; he is a businessperson and Entrepreneur. ",

In order for his project to be economically feasible, the cost of space travel will have to be drastically reduced. So here's what needs to happen. An initial group of 10 colonists will need to pay $500,000 a pop for the one-way trip to Mars. As the colony becomes increasingly self-sustainable -- and fewer resources need to be transported from Earth -- that will free up more space for additional human cargo. Transporting more and more paying customers, and relying on a \"rapid and reusable\" rocket, is key to Musk's price improvement strategy.\"Cheers.  ",

It is the application of known technology. Any novel ideas used in the design were probably designed by employees at his company, unless proven otherwise.I am not trying to discount what he has done, but I just do not think the title \"Inventor\" accurately reflects his occupation.

It doesn't need to be an either/or situation, and the fact is that he is busy \"inventing\" things.... no different than what Thomas Edison was doing with his various companies even though Edison also was a manager and had a large laboratory staff working for him as well.  If anything, I'd say Elon was a better entrepreneur, but that doesn't disqualify the title \"inventor\" from being used.

All inventors utilize existing technology of others, the embedded knowledge of other's advancements, to then make further advancements beyond what exists.  That is, they \"stand on the shoulders of giants.\"  Musk is doing the same.  Even if the basic rocket engines and RP1/LOX liquid-fueled rockets have been done before, it would appear to be Musk's vision and implementation that has knocked so much cost out of the traditional process for building and flying them; this includes the highly-fault-tolerant designs in the booster engines and in the computer control systems, as well as the super quick-turnaround time SpaceX has demonstrated for launch recycle after rocket anomalies on the launch pad. On the newer technology, it's pretty clear that it is Musk's vision for the whole \"fully and completely reusable\" objective, and for the methods SpaceX has been trying to get there, now in phase 2.  The current try is a funded effort to to build a VTVL booster (and, eventually, a VTVL second-stage) which requires a whole set of new technologies to be developed and tested before he has a hope of being successful\u2014although partial success has already been achieved with the low-altitude/low-speed vertical landing aspect.  Musk is behind many aspects of this, including the high-level system architecture to make the fully and rapidly reusable launch system possible. Having said all that, there is someone writing a biography now, so I'm guessing we'll see other sources soon, in addition to the large number of secondary sources that already attest to all of this.

            "comment": "The article starts with 'Elon Musk is a south african born Canadian-American business magnate, inventor....' Firstly I ask that investor is added. He is an investor in Solar City, Tesla, SpaceX, PayPal etc. He was also listed on Forbes 2014 Midas List of investors. http://www.forbes.com/video/3391084854001/ - This fully qualifies him as a investor. Which leads onto my next point that, in the Tesla Motors section of his biography, it states \"The company was co-founded by Martin Eberhard, Marc Tarpenning, JB Straubel, Ian Wright, and Musk.\" While this is correct it does not give the full picture and is misleading, as Musk was not part of the original team. Musk came in as after the original team was formed AND had incorporated the company in July 2003. He then became involved with the company in series A round of funding as a INVESTOR.  SOURCES: Mainly http://www.marketbusinessnews.com/tesla-motors/12064 (But also http://teslarumors.com/HowTeslaBegan) After a court case, it was declared he is in fact entitled to the 'cofounder' title, however this does not change the fact that he was not part of the original team, and that the company existed before his involvement. Rather that delete anything instead when listing cofounders simply add '.....Wright and Musk, however the company was incorporated by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning in 2003 prior to Musk's involvement.' This is also keeps Wikipedias neutral point of view. I ask that 'inventor' is removed from occupation, this implies he is inventing on a day-to-day basis. This is hugely untrue. The only this he could be considered for in terms of inventing is Hyperloop, when in actual fact all he has done is conceptualise it, while announcing it as an open source project. This means that even if it could be classified as inventing it would be more of a hobby that a occupation. However I also ask 'inventor' to be removed in the introduction titles Business Magnate, investor etc. This is again fro similar reasons above, but that compared to his activity as a entrepreneur and investor, conceptualising a SINGLE technology does not seem noteworthy or significant, for a introduction title. Yet he still did conceptualise it therefore should be noted somewhere later in the introduction, like it has been. However bearing it mind it has been as 'Musk conceptualised the Hyperloop, a high speed....' in the current situation (with inventor listed as well as conceptualiser of hyperloop) this implies he has invented a device which is not the Hyperloop, this is false, and there is no evidence of such a feat. In conclusion I ask the introduction titles to ...Canadian-American 'Business magnate and investor.' Change occupation to 'entrepreneur, businessman, investor' And change the Tesla Motors intro to one similar to that on the Tesla Motors page... 'Tesla Motors was cofounded by  Martin Eberhard, Marc Tarpenning, JB Straubel, Ian Wright, and Musk, however was incorporated by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning in 2003, one year prior to Musk's involvement.

See also the archived discussion here about this topic:  Talk:Elon_Musk/Archive_1#Inventor?This is IMHO an already resolved issue, so I don't know why this has been brought up again.  Elon Musk has invented several things, thus the distinction of being called \"an inventor\" is appropriate.  He shares several of these patents with presumably other employees of his, but he certainly participated in the development process and is named by the USPTO on those patents.Perhaps the solution here is to follow the pattern I've seen on some other articles and list the patents as a separate section with reference to the ideas being invented.  I assume that the USPTO counts as a reliable source here?  --",

I don't see anything in WP:MOS to suggest a reasonable way to get this done, so any suggestions or examples from other articles would be recommended.  The patents he has been granted relate to the work he did with both Zip2 and later on Tesla Motors.  Apparently the design of the Model X gull wing doors are specifically something that the USPTO has recognized as novel enough to give Elon Musk a patent.  Most of those patents are joint with other co-inventors, but his name is none the less on those patents.  --",

Registered this morning to pursue the debate as a registered user. Here is my case for why we should consider Musk to be a founder of both Tesla and PayPal:  Tesla: I previously referenced the cnet article () that was published after the Eberhard lawsuit.  In that article all five founders agreed to founding status for each. PayPal: As I note below Musk founded x.com which had the rights to the name PayPal and changed it's name to PayPal.  Eric, I believe in good faith, below asserts that this indicates he was not a founder of PayPal.  I believe this indicates the opposite. PayPal today was born as an amalgam of several companies.  We still think of Warren Buffet as the founder of Berkshire Hathaway.  That the company existed prior to his takeover is irrelevant.  The company he built in that name is all him.  I believe PayPal shows the same level of ownership/founding from Musk. Good Faith  This morning @ ~11ish GMT anon user ",

That should be the end of the matter per WP:NOR.  Even beyond that, the objections to PayPal are odd.  Many sources confirm that two companies were founded around the same time to address online payments.  There's no doubt that Musk was a founder of X.com, which later purchased a company called \"Confinity.\"  Confinity had started the \"Paypal\" brand (along with many others), but was not known as \"Paypal.\"  X.com (which Musk founded and was still involved with) then renamed itself \"PayPal\" and became what we know today as PayPal.  Musk was the founder of the company that became PayPal.com and the surviving legal entity.

The fact is that the company WAS NOT cofounded by Musk and he came in as a series A investor, now some may argue that that classifies him as a cofounder since he has invested a lot of his own money and time into it, but the fact is that it is the rare case of an early investor and CEO. However he came in approx. a YEAR after the company was founded, hence officially not making him a cofounder. But as Eric has said due to wikipedia's Neutral point of view it should be kept Early investor of Tesla Motors & Paypal (o keep neutral point of view) & Founder of SpaceX. Further more this is a direct wrote from the Tesla page \"Tesla Motors was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding. Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Elon Musk's involvement.\" ....Musk then became part of the company when he became a series A investor. There should be no dispute here. He was not a cofounder of the company but instead an early investor.  Unfortunately, your logic is flawed. For Wikipedia, it is not about what we can conclude from a source, it is what the source says. You state that the company \"WAS NOT cofounded by Musk\" but fail to provide a reference that states such. You can find references that state he was an early investor, but you are simply concluding that he was not a co-founder as the source only stated he was an early investor. The majority of sources out there state that he is a founder or co-founder and as such this should be the content that is kept. I cannot even find a source that says there is a controversy as to whether he is a co-founder or not. As such, the co-founder language should remain in the article. Consensus is also something that is not in your favor if you do not agree that the article should cite what the sources say. Consensus is what governs article content hence the reason for deletion discussions, talk page discussion, etc. A random check of the article's history shows that the consensus is that he is a co-founder. Here is one from 2013 which states \"He founded SpaceX and co-founded PayPal and Tesla Motors.\" Here is one from 2012 with the information box stating co-founder of the various companies. Here is one from 2011 with the same information in the info box. So I am not sure why this is a discussion, but I believe the co-founder status has been established through consensus as well as the references that state such. To argue otherwise, I would suspect there would need to be more than random IP editors editing from proxy servers in order to overturn such consensus. --",

Here is a direct quote from the policy (I used bold to emphasize the part that is the most appropriate in my view):\"Not truth: It is not good enough for information to be true, and it is definitely not good enough for you to (perhaps wrongly) believe it to be true. Wikipedia values accuracy, but it requires verifiability. You are allowed and encouraged to add material that is verifiable and true; you are absolutely prohibited from adding any material that is un-verifiable, with zero exceptions\u2014even if the un-verifiable material is true.\"So, with that in mind, there is nothing that needs \"clarified.\" In fact, if you are referring to this lawsuit, then I am not sure what information you want clarified as the lawsuit appears to have been dropped. Regardless, the reliable sources verify that he is a co-founder. What you believe or logically conclude from connecting the dots in whatever way you want is not something that belongs in Wikipedia. Quite simply, verifiability is the trump card.--",

One says that if the New York Times thinks that Musk is a \"founder\" of all three companies, then he is a founder of them based on WP:NOTTRUTH or because the lack of concrete standards for what constitutes a \"founder\" (on the incorporation papers? the next day? within a month? the surviving company or the surviving product?) mean that \"founder\" is a title more than an objective thing.  The other thinks that there is a set of objective criteria that must be fulfilled to be considered a \"founder\" even if the New York Times calls him a \"founder.\"  I've made an edit to split the difference by saying that he is considered a founder by reliable sources (which is true).  This acknowledges that sources like Forbes, the New York Times and the 20 others sources listed above call him \"founder\" of each company, but without taking a direct position on it.  It's not perfect, but can we call a truce on it?",

I'd go so far as to say it's a matter of opinion and interpretation whether or not he could be considered a founder of paypal. He didn't create that particular product, but he was definitely a founder of the company that owned it (and it was developed by that sub-company after acquisitionmisread an ambiguous sentence on the PayPal page), so... difficult situation. It's a grey area due to the ambiguity and near meaninglessness of the word \"founder\".It's kind of like wondering to yourself if Larry Page is a founder of the YouTube's Music Pass. Well, he definitely didn't found YouTube, but he did own the company when it developed Music Pass, so... yeah. Personally I think that's the wrong question to ask. Page didn't \"found\" Music Pass any more than Musk \"founded\" PayPal. He owned and ran the company that developed it, during its entire development period. But there isn't really a single word for \"the guy that ran the company when it developed a product\". Even \"investor\" falls short, as it doesn't encompass the running of the company. English needs a new word. \u2014 ",

The company included the DNA of several companies but was named PayPal.  The company we know today as PayPal began as x.com.  x.com was founded by Musk.  Ergo Musk founded PayPal.  Much in the way that Warren Buffet founded Berkshire Hathaway.  Does that make better sense? It's misleading, though.  Sure, I guess he founded the corporate entity that was for a period of time an independent company named \"PayPal\", but he didn't found Paypal.  Paypal isn't even independent anymore; there's nothing today at least called \"Paypal\" that he founded, is there?  I don't think Buffet is a good analogy here, and I don't think people would normally say he founded BH anyway! ",

He is called a magnate, real estate investor, business executive, and billionaire. If there is a source that leaves out calling him a billionaire should we remove that wording from his article? Absolutely not. So, we cannot hold on to a single reference that calls him an \"early investor\" without calling him a co-founder and use that as a basis to remove such from the article. Everything else is coming from people drawing conclusions from what is said in the media. Again, Wikipedia is not about our conclusion, it is about what the sources say. The overwhelming number of sources out there state that he is either an early investor, founder, or co-founder and as such all three would apply to be included in the article. So instead of concluding what PayPal was or is or could be, we simply need to stick to the sources. If stating he is a co-founder in Wikipedia is misleading, then so is the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and dozens of other articles from reliable sources that call him such. --",

This is a short, important-sounding snippet that bios which are controlled by Musk tend to use: for example, www.spacex.com/about/leadership or www.teslamotors.com/about/executives/elonmusk, so others copy and copy it in articles about some other aspect of Musk and it takes on a life of its own.  When in doubt, we can turn to sources that are more reliable for the claim being made.  I don't think you'll find any detailed or credible history of Paypal that calls him a \"cofounder of Paypal\".  He thinks of himself that way, obviously, but it's a tough case to make when the name and brand were invented at a company that you were not yet a part of.  This doesn't detract from his contribution to what Paypal is today, it's just not true that he is a cofounder. ",

Either explicitly or implicitly, some people seem to think that humans are a blight on the Earth\u2019s surface. They say things like, \u201cNature is so wonderful; things are always better in the countryside where there are no people around.\u201d They imply that humanity and civilisation are less good than their absence.

I\u2019ve thought about that quite a lot. I\u2019m trying to construct a world that maximises the probability that SpaceX continues its mission without me,\u2019 he said. I nodded toward a cluster of frames on his wall, portraits of his five sons. \u2018Will you give it to them?\u2019 He told me he had planned to give it to an institution, or several, but now he thinks that a family influence might be stabilising. \u2018I just don\u2019t want it to be controlled by some private equity firm that would milk it for near-term revenue,\u2019 he said. \u2018That would be terrible.\u2019  (emphasis added) \u2014",

Mentions the consulting group of experts that Musk brought together to advise him in getting started in Space, which I've only heard publically discussed one other time (a Space Show interview a year or two ago).  Mars Oasis gets a mention. The personal crises of 2007-2008, divorce, near-bankruptcy of both Tesla and SpaceX, etc. Perhaps less relevant to the Musk article, but could be used to improve other Wikipedia articles:  The naming of the Falcon 1 after Star Wars' Millenium Falcon (which is not currently included in the Falcon 1 article).  A description of the early development work on the Merlin 1A gas generator power turbine. The destruction of the rocket body (during air transport) of what was to have been the first successful Falcon 1 flight.  Substantial cost reduction in SpaceX in-house design of the avionic electronics.  The design/development schedule and delivery of the original Merlin 1 turbopump, from Barber-Nichols.  Early-years rocket engine development in California with 10-day trips to McGregor, Texas to test components and engines on the test stand. A somewhat detailed description of the inspiration for Robert Downey Jr. in the filming of the movie Iron Man.  A descriptive paragraph on price competition in launch might be useful in Space launch market competition.  50 flight backlog, with book of business of over $5 billion.   Oh, and at the end of the Bloomberg piece, one learns it is excerpted from a new book to be released later this month.  So there will be more to go through soon that might improve Wikipedia. ",

            "comment": "There are several problems with this section. Basically it's an attack on the subject based on an interpretation of a single source which does not present itself as a personal criticism of Musk, and it's therefore OR. The purpose of the referenced article is to look at the \"Great-Man Myth\" of technocracy and the damage that it can do through an analysis of Musk. Steve Jobs is also taken as an example. The article argues that placing Musk and others on a pedestal is \"inaccurate and unfair\" to others. It is claimed that Musk has an \"unwillingness to look beyond himself\" that is typical of such technocrats and can lead to nasty behaviour. Examples are given. The article's conclusion is that \"Rather than placing tech leaders on a pedestal, we should put their successes in context\" - in other words the thrust of the article is not criticism of Musk as an individual but as an example of a type. \"entitled behavior and brutishness to employees similar to Steve Jobs\" is a misreading of the source text which actually states that Musk is brusque and similarly Jobs was brutish.So this proposed section takes a general analysis focussed mainly around Musk as an attack on Musk himself as an individual, and presents a particular OR interpretation. If we're to have a section of personal criticisms of Musk it should be balanced. Alternatively, if this excellent reference is to be quoted it should be in a section about the mythology of Musk (Ironman and all). Now that would be an interesting read. ",

Liberals and progressives will laud Musk\u2019s commitment to addressing climate change, as well as his support for projects that attempt to wean the U.S. off an addiction to fossil fuels. Indeed, that is a goal well worth applauding. However, he is also hoisted up by writers such as Richard Eskow at Salon as an example of what happens to someone who casually hangs out with Silicon Valley style libertarians like Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen: they end up contracting second-hand libertarianism. This is unfortunate for folks like Eskrow, who believe \u201cgovernment is how we create a better world,\u201d and any infusion of libertarian style market-based economics would only sully the good work government is already doing. And it\u2019s not just the Left that complains about him. On the Right, conservatives and libertarians complain Musk is addicted to government subsidies, tax breaks, and easy government-backed loans\u2014the antithesis of everything a disruptive innovator from Silicon Valley should be embracing. Some praise his entrepreneurial spirit as quintessentially libertarian, while others contend he\u2019s a \u201cpretty shady dude\u201d who \u201cexhibits a clear pattern of cronyist behavior\u201d and argue that \u201cMusk is no libertarian. He\u2019s just damn good at playing the game.\u201d But if the major complaint against Musk is that his empire is fueled by government subsidies, then surely those complaints also apply to major conservative and libertarian donors whose companies also receive government handouts, despite stating their avowed opposition to subsidies. The reason for this position is clear: no company ever wants to place itself or its employees \u201cat a competitive disadvantage in the mixed-market economy in which [they] compete.\u201d Musk\u2019s businesses are no different.  \u2014 Cheers.

All his news announcements. How can you possibly be an up to date resource when you are wearing blinkers? No wonder everyone online has forgotten Wikipedia. You never get any media attention nowadays and Jimbo is too busy counting his personal finances to bother with the place nowadays. Wikipedia is dead and the funny part is it committed suicide. Oh well. That frees up a big chunk of the internet. The next time you get mentioned in the mainstream media it will doubtless be the announcement that you've gone bankrupt.

There is literally no way to point out which is definitive unless it is something coming from the person or company as their \"official\" Facebook group.  Why don't you start at that point and show some link (for example, something from his official Twitter account or a website Elon Musk has personal control over) that there is an official Facebook group page.  Is it some place Mr. Musk (or one of his trusted assistants in his behalf) regularly posts at?  That might be useful.  As a page for where people merely talk about Elon Musk, it is of dubious quality at best... especially if it is just a bunch of fans.  Keep in mind we are trying to write articles in an encyclopedia, not to make favor with the latest hip trends in the internet.  --",

The article took information that was already available, sensationalized it, and used it to villify the corporations. The government invests in a lot of companies through a variety of outlets; did the article mention that United Launch Alliance of Lockheed/Boeing gets more than $1 billion in annual subsidy by the government just to stay in business? No, instead they focused on the few million that Texas and other states is investing in SpaceX's launch sites which they hope will benefit the state in the future. This is because the article is an extremely biased work of journalism; it lies by omission.

Maybe he reads a lot of textbooks about engineering but it's not the same. Let's say that I read a lot about flowers and trees and I like gardening. Does this make me an arborist? Of course not. It's the same logic in this case. Someone do the correction in the article to not perpetuate this mistake.",

If you are reading books about flowers and trees and also engaged in the details of a landscaping business where you are actively involved in planting trees and working with customers on the health of various plants.... at what point do you become that arborist you claim you can't become?  Having an education background is sort of irrelevant excepting specific government requirments.... where that becomes a political issue and not a dictionary definition issue. It is better said that Elon Musk is an engineering manager on the same level as Werner Von Braun and Sergi Korolev.  With the kinds of rockets that have been built by SpaceX over the years, I think that is even a really fair comparison too.  Would those two managers be considered engineers?  Like Von Braun, Musk reviews the calculations and designs and gets into the technical details of the various projects he is involved with.  That is also why he retains the CTO title for SpaceX as well.... because he is also the head of engineering across the whole company and other engineering managers are responsible for individual departments or much smaller pieces of the company.  It is really hard to say that somebody working on that level and in that kind of detail on engineering projects is not an engineer either.  --",

That is what he went to school for, and that is widely considered better than an engineer, since they are the people who create the very equations that engineers use. Can an engineer be a mechanic as well, without training? You bet.Musk's rocket design mentor stated that he was the most intelligent person he had ever met, and that engineers often get insulted by his questions. His mentor (whos entry keeps being removed from wikipedia) states that musk knew the material so well that he could repeat it \"Verbatim\".Questioning his intelligence indirectly or challenging his ability to understand his own fields is uncalled for. He isnt some businessman pretending to be a rocket scientist, he is a very highly intelligent physicist and has very deep knowledge of rocketry and other fields. ",

He found that the University of Pennsylvania granted Musk's degrees in 1997 - two years later than what Musk has cited. I called Penn's registrar and verified these findings. Copies of Musk's records show that he received a dual degree in economics and physics in May 1997. ... Musk also had an explanation for the weird timing on his degrees from Penn. 'I had a History and an English credit that I agreed with Penn that I would do at Stanford,' he said. 'Then I put Stanford on deferment. Later, Penn's requirements changed so that you don't need the English and History credit. So then they awarded me the degree in '97 when it was clear I was not going to go to grad school, and their requirement was no longer there. I finished everything that was needed for a Wharton degree in '94. They'd actually mailed me a Wharton degree. I decided to spend another year and finished the physics degree, but there there was that History and English credit thing. I was only reminded about the History and English thing when I tried to get an H-1B visa and called the school to get a copy of my graduation certificate, and they said I hadn't graduated. Then they looked into the new requirements, and said it was fine.\"Basically, it should say the Penn degrees were awarded in May 1997, as the facts indicate.  \u2014 Preceding unsigned comment added by ",

The term is particularly apt when applied or self-applied to people with strong ties to Canada, such as those who have lived a significant portion of their lives or were educated in Canada, and then relocated to the United States.

Anyway, the fact of the situation that no source about relationships will ever be good enough for Wikipedia's exacting standards. Not even if they literally make Instagram posts tacitly saying \"we're in a relationship\" and \"I've bonded with his kids so this is serious\". Of course magazines like People have to add a little bit of puffery like \"Amber Heard and Elon Musk just can\u2019t keep their hands off of each other\", because that's the celebrity journalism nature. But People is a way better source than rags like the Daily Mail or US Weekly when it comes to these things. Acknowledging sources on relationships doesn't mean we're turning Wikipedia into a gossip encyclopedia because real relationships aren't gossip and no one ever puts things like \"Amber Heard and Elon Musk just can\u2019t keep their hands off of each other\" on this site anyway. Her dad confirmed the relationship too.  \u2014 Preceding unsigned comment added by ",

Aluminum was chosen in the belief that it would be a good lightning rod tip.

Canada does not force citizenship on people who may not want to have Canadian citizenship.

There needs to be an established reason why having Canadian citizenship is not in and of itself grounds to apply the demonym \"Canadian\" to that person. So far in this discussion, the argument I am criticizing here is the only argument that seeks to argue against Canadian citizenship being grounds to use the demonym. With that argument nullified, I see no argument in here right now against the reverting back to it saying \"Canadian American\". One would need to establish why both citizenship and having lived there would not be grounds for the demonym, with precedents from other Wikipedia articles, which I have not yet seen posted here. For that reason, I feel it should be reverted back to its original form until that argument and precedent can be established. (5/18/2018)  ",

Most bios describe the person's life in chronological order, so at whatever point in time they were criticized or involved in a controversy is where that content belongs. Or if you have one section where all the SpaceX stuff is, then all the SpaceX controversy goes there, not off somewhere else. If another section is all Tesla, then the Tesla controversy belongs there.Because of the special reluctance that Wikipedia has to include negative content about living persons, I'd wait a few days to a few weeks, or even more, before adding this stuff, and only if citing the best quality sources. It is not urgent that a Wikipedia article be up to the minute current with the latest headlines.All that being said, yes.

Any negative fact about a living person can turn out to be something else tomorrow: mistaken identity, hacked account, ulterior motives. It's very rare and unlikely, especially when a professional publication has fact checked it. But it does happen. And there is run of the mill nuance, mitigating facts that come to light once there is time for detailed investigation.On the other hand, what reasons do we have to feel like we have to add this content immediately? None. If the article fails to mention this controversy for a few days, even for a few weeks, so what? In some sense, it helps remind everyone that Wikipedia is not a newspaper, which is always helpful.The fact that it is covered in every major news outlet around the globe ensures that nobody has missed out on this news. It isn't as if leaving it out of this article will mean someone is unaware of it. It only underscores that WP is not a newspaper and should never feel the slightest pressure to keep up with the very latest developments.So whatever we write today might be minimally adequate, but what we write in two days or ten days will be significantly better. I would say the same on any BLP. Be a sloth. Take your sweet time. Wikinews is a great outlet for those itching to write something right now this second. --",

But the government of Canada did not make its laws just for Elon Musk. They made them for everyone, including those who were born in countries that do not allow dual citizenship and who have at least one Canadian parent. If Canada just made them citizens at birth, they could be denied citizenship and deported by the country that doesn't allow dual citizenship. It is very likely that the Supreme Court of Canada would void any such law if it existed, which it doesn't.The reason why the Canadian laws say you are automatically a citizen if, like Ted Cruz, you are born in Canada is because this is unlikely to cause any problems with citizenship in any other country. I know of no county that does not allow dual citizenship that also automatically makes a person born in another country a citizen. As far as I can tell every such country either has a rule saying that in such cases you have to apply for citizenship and renounce your citizenship in the other country or a rule saying that in such cases you are not eligible to be a citizen. --",

His mother was born in Canada and even if he claimed citizenship in 1989, the 2009 changes to the law retroactively and automatically made him a Canadian citizen since birth. That 1989 date needs to be changed to his birth year date of 1971 and left alone. There is nothing to debate. This is straight from the Canadian government:  First generation born outside Canada who was granted Canadian citizenship before April 17, 2009 [paragraph 3(1)(h)] Citizen\u2019s date of birth: between January 1, 1947, and February 14, 1977 Paragraph 3(1)(h) recognizes as Canadian citizens persons born outside Canada to a Canadian parent between January 1, 1947, and February 14, 1977, and who did not become citizens by descent, but who were granted citizenship under section 5 of the 1977 Act before April 17, 2009. Under this paragraph, such persons are recognized as citizens by descent as a result of the legislative amendments on April 17, 2009, instead of citizens by way of grant [pursuant to subsection 3(6)], and their citizenship is retroactive to their date of birth [pursuant to paragraph 3(7)(e)].  --",

For example, in the United States, people born within borders of the country are automatically citizens. They are not asked if they want the citizenship or not, the United States automatically recognizes those people as citizens (whether they want it or not). If they don't want it, they have to renounce the citizenship and pay over two thousand dollars. Second, at the time Musk applied for the citizenship, the law was different. The Canadian government changed the law in 2009 and 2015. As I quoted directly from the official Canadian government website, they did in fact make all Canadians in the first generation abroad automatically and retroactively citizens back to the date of birth. Therefore, those people who became citizens earlier that were in the first generation abroad (i.e. Musk in 1989) are no longer recognized as being citizens from that date. They are now recognized as being citizens since birth (which for Musk is 1971). There is no need for any other sources. It's right there. You clearly do not know anything at all about Nationality Law and what the words automatic and retroactive mean. Yes, countries do grant citizenship to people without their consent all the time and they do change their laws. And yes, even though at the time he had to file the paperwork to become a citizen, his citizenship is no longer recognized as beginning on that date, but now it is recognized since his birth, and that is without consulting him.

I am not trying to shift the goal posts; it is simply that from surveying the sources, the vast majority of the time Elon Musk is described as an entrepreneur or CEO of Tesla/Paypal or something along the lines of that - including say Britannica, which says \"South African-born American entrepreneur\", with no mention of any engineering anywhere.

We will know in six months whether the issue has any encyclopedic significance because if it has, secondary sources will have recorded ways in which Musk's reputation or business have been affected. Further, if notable person A says non-notable person B is a pedophile (later withdrawn), repeating the slur throws mud at B, some of which would stick.

It is commonplace on Wikipedia to see the nationality-citizenship of a person given in their initial description, so it is certainly appropriate to add this information to Elon's page. Please note that he is not \"African American\" but \"African-American\" and that this distinction is important.

He's a fundraising genius, and LP in venture funds.\" A commenter named Justin replied, \"Wikipedia doesn't normally accept edits contradicted by old urls but it is elon who wants to change history.\" Lora Kolodny subsequently tweeted (with cc to Jimmy Wales), \"Asking for someone to axe a fact from his own bio, then getting @Wikipedia editors to acquiesce is going well beyond Musk asking for deserved recognition of the other things he does.\" She also retweeted a link to a May 7, 2019 MarketWatch story, \"Tesla CEO Elon Musk spent $25 million to buy more stock, boosting stake to nearly 20%,\" which suggests that he is still very much an investor, in Tesla at least. I add this to our discussion because Wikipedia may face blowback for altering Mr. Musk's BLP at his request, and I am one of the editors who did so. The idea that we have shown him special favor is, I believe, false.

We as editors aren't here to go over facts, apply definitions, and then decide what we think the best way to frame Musk is. That's original research and a synthesis of things that are not represented by the sources. Instead, we rely on what is said in independent sources. Additionally, Musk's comments about his reasons for putting funding into AI firms are not to be given as much weight in the context of the investor title. Yes, we can obviously use those comments as a source for the statement \"Musk said that he bought into the firms to keep an eye on AI...\" but nothing more. In this case, you applying what he said to a definition of investor is not the kind of policy-based arguments that will decide this for us--whether or not independent reliable sources call him an investor is what matters. Nole (chat\u00b7edits)I saw Musk's tweet within a couple minutes of him originally tweeting it and by the time I came here, most mentions of investing had been stripped from the lede. His twitter account is about as WP:PRIMARY as you can get, and I think we need to be extremely careful in using that as the guide for what happens on this page. I have a lot of concerns about Musk using WP as a platform for him to rebrand, and at the very least we should hold off on further removals of \"investor\" around the wiki until we come to some consensus about, per ",

He stated that it made him reconsider working on a collider after realizing that it can be cancelled at any time by the government.  At 21 minutes he discusses his experience on the early internet, where he states he was only early to the internet because it was normal in the physics community, and states that it was almost all basic text at the time.  At 22 minutes he states he is not interested in genetically engineering humans.  At 28 minutes he states he previously wanted to use x86 computer chip manufacturing tech to manufacture capacitors at precisions far beyond existing tech. As capacitor density relies on area and space between plates, using chip manufacturing tech would have theoretically greatly improved energy density. He states that it has now become unnecessary. Around 35 minutes he states that he chose China for the first foreign factory because it was the center of electric car production, and also the tariffs causing a situation where they could not sell in China if they did not produce locally. He also states there is a lot of talent and drive in China which makes it a good place to do business, and that the quality of cars being produced is very high.

Describing Elon Musk as an engineer is misleading in that it implies that he has qualifications and education which in reality, he does not possess.  It is true that Musk describes himself as an engineer, however, as evidenced by the \"Business Magnet\" discussion on this talk page, that is not sufficient reason to include such a title in this article. It is my opinion that the word \"engineer\" in the opening sentence should be removed, resulting in the following: \"Elon Reeve Musk FRS (/\u02c8i\u02d0l\u0252n/; born June 28, 1971) is an industrial designer, technology entrepreneur, and philanthropist.\" ",

That's absurd; one is an engineer if a group of others or an institution ascribes the title to the person. The source provided is an archived profile from ASME.org which states the following: While Mr. Musk does not have an engineering degree per say (sic), he holds degrees in Physics and Economics from the University of Pennsylvania, few dispute his assertion, in response to his focus on technical details as CEO of Tesla and Space X, \"I'm an engineer, so what I do is engineering. That's what I'm good at. That strikes me as a strange thing for a reliable source to disclose, especially if it also used against someone disputing whether Musk is an engineer or not. Firstly, it admits that he doesn't have a degree in engineering, so that removes institutional ascription. Secondly, it doesn't provide any evidence of some poll or survey conducted to determine if engineers or even laymen think of Musk as an engineer (i.e. ascription by group of others); it simply asserts that \"few\" dispute it. Does the number of those who dispute it matter? No, one should suffice. This leaves the argument with little strict recourse and therefore leads one to doubt how reliable it actually is. However, the archived article also later describes him as a \"practical engineer\", which is admittedly ambiguous but also provides a clue as to what the article is attempting to do with regards to Musk's status. All that is needed is some further analysis. Now, is the article referring to him as one with a degree in practical eng           ineering? Probably not, because the article already pointed out that Musk doesn't have an engineering degrees and reliable sources don't deal in contradictions. Therefore, unless we allow that the source contains false information, it must mean that Musk is to be considered an engineer in some loose sense of the term, as in an engineer in practice. Given this analysis of the source material, I recommend the first line be changed to reflect this looser qualification: Musk is an engineer insofar as he's an engineer in practice. ",

[6] If you get a CNN or Snopes page or something solid that really supports this claim, then that's different- but what you're giving me is an article from a person that perennially makes wild claims about Musk including that 'teenage Elon Musk once casually sold his father's emeralds to Tiffany & Co. while his dad was sleeping'. NONSENSE. If you want to put this back in the article, you should put it in the right place chronologically too: this \"allegedly happened\" in the mid-1980s, which should probably not be before the paragraph about the man's childhood.

Can we rework the passage with the \"childhood to teen\" thing and some clarification on what exactly the lie Elon saw on Twitter is? ",

The sentence was not directly claimed by Errol himself in the article. It is not wise for us to make deWet's leap for him and assume Errol really actually made the claim that the emerald mine was geographically situated within Zambia. The one instance of the use of the word 'Zambian' later on in deWet's interpretative writing narrative does not imply location per se- it could imply ownership (the Italians may have roots in Zambia but the mine is on the South African border, or perhaps the workers were Zambian but the mine was in South Africa) or other factors unknown at this time. What we can say is that we do not have direct evidence Errol claimed he was half-owner of an emerald mine in Zambia in a 2018 interview, because that wording does mot appear in any of his alleged quotations, nor does deWet say Errol said that. Only appears in deWet's big lie of a clickbait title, and we are making an extra leap outside of what deWet wrote to say Errol's alleged claims included that geographical component. I, for one, am not inclined to be so imaginative and would prefer rigorous adherence to whatever \"facts\" there are in this \"news interview\". ",

But if this partial stake was just something temporary that happened for a few years and didn't pan out, the clicks would be considerably reduced.

But I would never confuse the story of the Great International Teenage Emerald Heist of 19 and 88 with an actual reality on Earth in actual human history. Could 16 year olds off the street legally sell emeralds to Tiffanys in NYC in the 80s? No, probably not. Would Tiffanys even want emeralds of unclear origin? Seems like it undercuts their reputation if they do that! But that's not the point! In a fiction narrative, you can kind of just bend the rules of reality a little.

Well, after a few days, I think I'm still quite firmly in the camp that none of the emerald stuff should appear on the Elon Musk page itself (could be included on conspiracy theory pages) without further confirmation, 1) about the specific nature of the emerald mine claims and 2) about the direct relevance said emerald mine claims to Mr. Elon Musk. Here are some new points I've come up with:  The last sentence of the Wednesday, February 28, 2018 06:30 AM article from Mr. Phillip de Wet ([14], archived [15]) reads, and I quote: \"And, on at least one occasion, his [Mr. Errol Musk's] now famous son [Mr. Elon Musk] also took his hand [meaning: tried his hand] at dealing in the gems, with peculiar results.\"(My clarifications in italics) Note that hyperlink in the quotation I provide here is also seen in the article proper. The hyperlink in that quote goes to a Thursday, February 22, 2018 02:48 PM article from Mr. Phillip de Wet ([16], archived [17]) in which Mr. Errol Musk is said to describe wildly implausible incidents set in late 1980's New York City concerning young Mr. Elon Musk, Mr. Kimbal Musk and Tiffany's, an American luxury jewelry and specialty retailer. In Mr. Phillip de Wet's own words from the second to last sentence of the Thursday, February 22, 2018 02:48 PM article, and I quote: \"BI SA reached out to Elon for confirmation of the tale, but he did not respond.\" Use of the word 'tale' to refer to a story which is on its face totally impossible shows that Mr. Phillip de Wet himself (or his editors) are having some degree of trouble accepting the validity of Mr. Errol Musk's alleged claims. They published a 'tale', and there is no claim that this is vetted, factual information usable in a Wikipedia article. For Mr. Phillip de Wet to link his Wednesday, February 28, 2018 06:30 AM article to the 'tale' (the Thursday, February 22, 2018 02:48 PM article) shows that there is some level of connection between the two articles, and I would argue that the factual validity of the two articles is inextricably linked, being published in quick succession, about five and a half days apart. The Thursday, February 22, 2018 02:48 PM article shows that the source of quotations from Mr. Errol Musk include wild fantasies about impossible events and, by association, the Wednesday, February 28, 2018 06:30 AM article is thereby put into at least some level of doubt. The Thursday, February 22, 2018 02:48 PM article also says, and I quote: \"\u201cWe were very wealthy,\u201d says Errol. \u201cWe had so much money at times we couldn't even close our safe.\u201dWith one person holding the money in place, another other would slam the door.\u201cAnd then there'd still be all these notes sticking out and we'd sort of pull them out and put them in our pockets.\u201d\" We are asked to imagine a safe filled so full of crumpled bills that they pour out of the safe, similar to the one appearing in the music video \"Iggy Azalea - Kream ft. Tyga\" ([18]) at 0:04, 0:36, 0:44, 0:48, 0:52, 1:27, 2:32 etc. This type of situation is a common literary device symbolizing prosperity and wealth which is used to great effect in the music video. However, an actual safe with crumpled and disorderly bills would to me signify minor success within a context of overall financial poverty- as I would understand things, the safe of a rich person is orderly and the money is grouped into stacks (as will be seen below in the case of the Italians and their safe). I suspect that the mechanism by which one person would be \"holding the money in place\" while another would \"slam the door\" of the safe was so wildly implausible, even to Mr. Phillip de Wet, that he omitted the direct quotation he could have used at this point (if the story is not fabricated). What exactly was it that was supposedly purchased by Mr. Errol Musk? According to the Wednesday, February 28, 2018 06:30 AM article from Mr. Phillip de Wet, and I quote: There, the two South Africans [Mr. Errol Musk and his co-pilot] ran into a group of Italians who, as it happened, were in the market for an airplane. Errol named his price, and a deal was done.\u201cSo we went to this guy's prefab and he opened his safe and there was just stacks of money and he paid me out, \u00a380,000, it was a huge amount of money,\u201d he said.Standing with the cash in his hand, Errol was made another offer he couldn\u2019t refuse: Would he like to buy half an emerald mine for half of his new riches [presumably about \u00a340,000]?\u201cI said, \u2018Oh, all right\u2019. So I became a half owner of the mine, and we got emeralds for the next six years.\u201d(My clarifications in italics) A single-engine plane can apparently cost $15,000 to $100,000 in modern-day USD, and a multi-engine plane can be purchased for between $75,000 and $300,000 according to the article 'Economics of Owning a Small Plane' ([19]) on Investopedia. Therefore, I think that the \u00a380,000 figure is actually plausible as the price for the small plane. Now here's the crux of the issue: what if I were a swindler that wanted to get a plane cheap? I might tell the seller that I have an emerald mine that I wanted to sell a half-share in for half the cost of the plane. If the mark fell for the deal, I might send the mark a few emeralds for the next six years and then tell him the mine went out of business for some reason. Because, my friends, I do not yet have the ability to accept that half ownership in an emerald mine can be purchased for \u00a340,000. Was there ever an emerald mine on this earth in which half ownership could be purchased for 40,000 quid? Indeed, there are emerald mines in Zambia and South Africa ([20]). How much do they cost? On Quora someone asked a similar question: \"How much money does it cost to start a large-scale emerald mine in Nigeria?\" [21] The answers: \"It will be in the order of 10's to 100's of millions US$, depending on the size of the operation, the size and shape of the deposit, the quality and concentration of the gemstones, local infrastructure (i.e. what you need to build and how expensive transport is), etc.\" (from a student at University of Pretoria) and \"Setup costs will be in the order of $50m in equipment.  Land use consultants will cost another $2-5m.  Wages for a 100 strong workforce will be $250,000 per month, and about the same for the 5-8 geologist, engineers and managers you will need.\" (from a CEO, Director, CIO, Engineering Manager). Based on this, I believe that a half share in a small emerald mine with one geologist would be worth more than the cost of an airplane. Mr. Errol Musk might ardently and passionately believe that he was once the half owner of an emerald mine, but based on the alleged quotes given us in Mr. Phillip de Wet's articles, I think we can safely say that more investigation of his claims in this area would be warranted before we add them on the Biography of a Living Person on Wikipedia. Just because Business Insider might be considered a reliable source in some areas doesn't mean that we should believe everything we read on the internet. Dollar dollar bill y'all. ",

Firstly, there's a lot of YouTube sources being used, which should be discouraged in favour of news articles and other easily verifiable sources. Moreover, a lot of the YouTube videos are used for statements of facts, not opinions; e.g. there are interviews with Musk where he says something about what happened at Tesla etc. - Musk alone is not a reliable source of information. Another tendency is using Musk's tweets as sources - again, this is discouraged. We should be supporting things using quality secondary sources. A lot of the claims in the article are interpretations of his tweets. For instance, the claim that the Boring Company was inspired to sell flamethrowers because of the film Spaceballs is supported just by a tweet where Musk says The *real* money comes from merchandising. I learned it from this documentary and links to a YouTube video with a scene from the film. Clearly we can't make a claim like that since it's a farfetched interpretation of what is being said in the tweet. We have to be careful. ",

However, Musk's tweet about this paper was already on March 16, while the paper was described as \"widely discredited\" only on April 29. The whole sentence from the source is in fact \"He promoted a widely discredited paper on the benefits of chloroquine, which was debunked so quickly that both Twitter and Google Docs refused to host it\". So the paper was discredited (and pulled) only after Musk tweeted about it, and as such the partial quote is misleading, since it communicates that the paper had already been (widely) discredited when Musk tweeted about it. To get a correct and NPOV, I have changed this to Musk \"promoted a paper on the benefits of chloroquine that was widely discredited and pulled down by Google\". ",

The Italian data he quoted was posted 9:28 AM Mar 20, 2020 compared with the original tweet at 8:55 AM Mar 20, 2020- it is clearly a two part tweet. The CDC data was posted later as further support. Nothing I have added is interpretation or a claim- it is only statements of facts with direct citations supporting them.

Additional information with supporting citations should not be reverted, for the reasons discussed here. ",

To be clear, I of course agree that disallowing original research is a key policy of wikipedia, and that quoting a sequence of primary sources to push a narrative can in some cases be synthesis of published material. However, I think that expanding a quote fragment to the full quote (and in the case of twitter to give both parts of a two-part tweet) can only provide unbiased context and is not synthesis and is an allowed use of primary sources, even if the full quote is not give in secondary sources. It would be interesting to get the \"official\" wikipedian view on that, but in any case thanks for the discussion and your efforts to remove original research. ",

Sure, it seems pretty logical that the images of the diagrams Musk posted were an attempt to back up his claim; and you can take another logical step and assume that he was indeed pointing at no deaths in Italy to support his claim. But first of all, that doesn't even support his claim (the diagram doesn't talk about non-lethal infections), but most importantly, this is our interpretation of what he's done there. If things like that are worth including in an article, it should be easy to find a secondary source confirming our interpretation. As I've shown above, using our own interpretations is a slippery slope, as it's easy to make a false claim. ",

He has never been hired by anyone for an engineering position. He has a handful of patents that he has co-authored and I urge someone to admit that any of them are terribly sophisticated.

The infobox's claim that Hillsborough doesn\u2019t seem solid. Musk has multiple homes, many which are not in Hillsborough. The one which pops up the most is one in Bel Air. The word \"hometown\" implies that Musk lives entirely in that city and has made major contributions to the community, but this is not an apt description. An example of an actual hometown would be Elvis and Memphis, or LBJ and Johnson City. The validity of Hillsborough as his hometown is further weakened by the fact that Musk is selling all of his homes. The infobox is already bloated and I support its removal. Hopefully you agree. Thanks! ~ ",

            "comment": "Elon Musk is not a co-founder of Tesla. The word co-founder has a concrete meaning. It is not a fluid title like CEO that can be reassigned. A settlement or a company decision does not change who is a co-founder. A claim from Musk or Tesla does not change who is co-founder. Beyond that, per WP:BLPSELFPUB we do not accept primary sources that make self-serving and reasonably disputed claims. As evidence that there is dispute, numerous secondary sources report that Elon Musk is not the co-founder of Tesla, instead naming Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning Tesla's co-founders.I'm aware there are conflicting sources, so here is a tertiary source, Encyclopedia Britannica: Tesla, Inc., formerly (2003\u201317) Tesla Motors, American electric-automobile manufacturer. It was founded in 2003 by American entrepreneurs Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning and was named after Serbian American inventor Nikola Tesla. Nowhere does it state that Musk co-founded Tesla. Quote from Wikipedia policy WP:TERTIARY: Reliable tertiary sources can be helpful in providing broad summaries of topics that involve many primary and secondary sources, and may be helpful in evaluating due weight, especially when primary or secondary sources contradict each other. But you know what I find interesting, is that in 2010 Tesla publicly states that Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning are the founders: Tesla Motors was founded in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning to create efficient electric cars for people who love to drive. Later in the article Tesla names Musk a chairman, but not a co-founder. Let's be serious. Wikipedia is not a marketing launch point or a place for rewriting history. Musk is a major influence on Tesla, but not a co-founder. Maybe we should say that Tesla claims Musk is a co-founder, but not without the WP:BALANCE of conflicting reports, not in the WP:VOICE of Wikipedia, and not without WP:INTEXT attribution. --",

He has no engineering experience and no education to that effect. The title of engineer is not an honorific and should not be treated as one just because he owns a company where engineers work. A source for showing that he is not an engineer is not needed. The current source, [5], states that he does not hold an engineering degree. This source only offers a quote of Elon Musk stating he is an engineer. This does not show the proper qualifications to list him as an engineer. ",

He has never been hired by anyone for an engineering position. He has a handful of patents with his name on them and I urge someone to admit that any of them are terribly sophisticated. Change the sentence to convey that he considers himself to be one or that he has been awarded honorary degrees in it and call it a day.",

I feel, that if this encyclopedia wants to use the word \"engineer\" with Elon Musk, then we should at least word with some morsel of truth and use the same wording Elon Musk uses to describe himself on his website: \"Elon Musk leads a team of engineers but has no formal education in engineering and is not licensed to practice engineering.\"  ",

And if we have to mention \"engineer\" why make it sound so matter of fact, when it's not even a true thing? So, since we know he is not engineer, why mention \"engineer\" at all? Wouldn't be easier, and more truthful to just leave \"engineer\" out?  Or, if we have to include it, could we at least put some truth behind it and say something like, \"Xmedia say Musk is an engineer ....\" or something truthful like that?

I will not say that the purpose of the image is to draw up this tension between Musk and the state of the pandemic - the purpose of the image is to add a contextual visual element that is a bit more fresh than the typical viral particle image everyone has seen a billion times already - but I believe it injects some keen subtext to the article worth preserving.

It is simply factually incorrect that the \"lead diver\" (Richard Stanton), or indeed any diver at the rescue sued Musk. The suit was by Vernon Unsworth, a recreational caver who had previously explored the cave and who had played a purely advisory role in the rescue and was not involved in any dives, as stated correctly in the body text.  Can you provide a citation for the claim that a rescue diver sued Musk (that is not itself an error by a journalist)?. Particularly for a BLP such blatant unsubstantiated factual errors should be removed immediately. Moreover, the whole paragraph is predominantly biased editorial opinion without context given, and such original synthesis is also not allowed. For example, the biased wording in the claim that \"When his submarine was rejected as a viable option for the 2018 Tham Luang cave rescue, Musk called a lead-diver a \"pedo-guy\"\" implies to the reader that Musk criticized a lead diver directly because the submarine was not used. This is not the case, as described in the body text, Musk's insult was directly in reply to a previous insult by Unsworth. Also the usage of the term \"scandals\" is biased usage. This whole paragraph is written with a biased POV, is factually incorrect and is unsuitable for a lede, and should be removed immediately.  1.129.110.229 (talk)  I have adjusted the lead portion regarding the diver after reviewing the sources.

Give people back their goddamn freedom.[366] To support the claim that he called lockdowns fascist however it has since been changed to this: So, the extension of the shelter-in-place, and frankly I would call it forcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights \u2014 my opinion \u2014 and erasing people's freedoms in ways that are horrible and wrong, and not why people came to America or built this country. What the fuck? Excuse me.[347] We should restore it to the original quote as this quote does not make any sense in the context of him calling COVID fascist. I listened to the call originally and he did say both however it makes no sense to follow: \"When the Alameda County Sheriff ordered all non-essential businesses to shut down, Musk and Tesla initially refused to comply, arguing that vehicle manufacturing and energy infrastructure are critical sectors, citing the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.[345][346] Musk called the lockdown 'fascist' on a Tesla earnings call stating:\" ",

Feeling uncomfortable or painful about pronouns is something experienced by people who do not identify with the gender society ascribes to them Like Trans-people non-binary-people gender-fluid people etc. The statement could aswell be interpreted as an anti gender / feminist viewpoint.  This is supported by musks child with grimes having a gender neutral name and being called gender neutral pronouns. According to a guardian article grimes would prefer to wear a moustache. Elon musk twittered that tesla scored 100/100 four years in a row on lgbtq equality.  The culture of Ian banks culture series wich seems to inspire elon musk ( neuralink- neural lace / the landing platforms having names of culture space ships etc.)  do rarely use gender pronouns and see gender as signifying brutality and hierarchy.  I read these books and people there swap out their genitals from time to time.  The source cited gives no reason why \u201epronouns suck\u201c is transphobic. As the current state of the article paints a one-sided controversial picture of elon musk that is based on not well founded assumptions i request the removal of this interpretation.  ",

            "comment": "There is a great deal of biased negativity in this article. I will elaborate: 1: \"After his submarine was rejected as a viable option for the 2018 Tham Luang cave rescue, he called a diver advising the rescue a \"pedo guy\" While it is true that he has had a dispute with a British cave diver and called him these words in a tweet, this wording paints the whole incident in a more negative light on Elon's part. He did NOT tweet it because his \"submarine was rejected\". He tweetet it because the british cave diver told him to \"stick the submarine up where the sun doesn't shine\" (Reference). This puts the entire incident in a very different light.  2: The entire VIEWS section needs a lot of editing to make it much less biased. For each opinion that Elon has expressed publicly a source is in almost every single case found that sharply contradicts his statements while ALSO putting him or his opinion in a very negative light. This is a BIG complaint about this article in general. Elon Musk is known to be at the cutting edge of technology with his companies and has in the past proved time and time again that his opinions are often (but not always) correct even if there are a lot of \"experts\" who disregards his opinion as nonsense.  My point is that for every single opinion in a given field it is possible to find an \"expert\" that says it is wrong. That does not mean the article has to contain it - that would make for some really blurred articles on Wikipedia. And it does not help the matter that most of if not all the opinions used in the article to contradict Musk's opinion are very negative in their tone towards him. Let us look at some examples: In \"Artificial Intelligence\" A source used is a person from Facebook. \"Facebook's AI head, Jerome Persati, said that Musk has \"no idea what he is talking about when he talks about AI\", with CNBC reporting that Musk is \"not always looked upon favorably\" by the AI research community\".  Is this seriously good enough for Wikipedia guys? Does this hold up to the unbiased standards that should be held for an important article as this?  In Short selling and subsidies Elon has a sceptic stance towards short selling. The sources used to counter his stance is very negative in their tone towards him. It is undeniable that their has been a LOT of false rumours attributed to the short sellers through the last 5 years that has been spread about Tesla. However, one does only have to look at the massive increase at the share price today to see how much it has risen in the recent year. One of the primary reasons for this rise is that short sellers has been able to keep the stock price down for a long time thanks to misleading and false rumours. Without these false rumours Tesla would have begun this massive rise many years ago. So one can argue that Elon has a very valid point. Anyway, in any case it makes for a very biased article to find sources that contradicts his statements so harshly. This is not needed and only includes their own irrelevant speculations. All in all this article does not hold up to the standards that Wikipedia should hold up for its own articles. Again, one cannot deny that Elon is at the forefront on many technologies. And every time the boundaries are pushed there is going to be \"experts\" that disagrees. A great example is how Neil Degrasse Tyson expressed strong disbelief (as well as many other \"expert\" rocket scientists) that SpaceX would never be able to succeed with their private space endeavour, and that it would be utter impossible to land a rocket back on the earth. They proved them very wrong.  Someone needs to make a serious editing of this whole article to make it less biased.  Disagree entirely. ",

Let us take the Facebook source for example - you use a source from a company that Elon has expressed dislike for and you do not believe this makes for a dishonest source? Seriously? The article uses a source that has every reason to talk negatively about Elon. I would also like to point out this sentence: \u201cMusk has also been the subject of criticism due to unorthodox or unscientific stances\u201d. Who is to decide that his views are unscientific? Do you have to read your own article through to be reminded what Elon Musk has archived? The guy who helped found Paypal (even that fact is eschewed to make it sound like Elon did not found Paypal but Peter Thiels team did), he created the worlds first private company to launch rockets, he and his team created the worlds first reusable rocket (which all the \u201cexperts\u201d called impossible and dumb to even try - this includes Neil Degrasse Tyson and Neil Armstrong who was a vocal critic of SpaceX), then he helped create Tesla, the first new car company to succeed in more than 50 years from the US. Then he led Tesla to mass produce their cars which in turn has singlehandedly forced the entire car industry to make a shift into EVs. Tesla popularity is due in large part because of being at the forefront of many new technologies: they are far ahead (or at least at the very very front) on battery technology and on Self driving technology. My point is that a man who is unscientific in his world view does not archive what this man has archived and does not attract the worlds top engineers. Let us call it what it is: an insult to his achievements, and again, very negatively biased. You can even argue that his achievements are thanks in large part to Elon being extremely scientific and following first principles. This isn't rocket science guys - oh wait, it is: The founder, CEO and CTO of the worlds first private rocket company I would argue has to be extremely scientific - would you not and would you not in turn also agree that it is reason enough to remove the \"unscientific\" part? Besides all this, if you push the boundaries (and disrupts entire industries) there will always be \u201dexperts\u201d who will call your ideas impossible, unrealistic and even unscientific. That does NOT mean that they should be included in an unbiased Wiki article. [User:",

My whole point is that a lot of these sources are in themselves not reliable and only adds their own irrelevant opinion. It is not my \"personal view\" that he has succeeded in business that were deemed impossible to succeed in (shall I find a source to confirm this for you?). again this is not a \"personal view\" - \"experts\" have called his ideas impossible for the last 20 years (yes, we can find MANY sources for this) and yet he has succeeded again and again. To make for an objective and good article sources or not needed who contradicts and critics the source - where in the Wiki guidelines is that a requirement? Please answer this question as well. EDIT: I just found another great bit from the article - this is starting to get hilarious for the way the negativity is spread. In the section \"PUBLIC TRANSPORT\" there is this great line: \"Afterwards, he dismissed an audience member's response that public transportation functioned effectively in Japan.[312][313]\". If you read the source he actually gives quite a reasonable reply than merely \"dismissing\" it. He answered: \"What, where they cram people in the subway? That doesn\u2019t sound great.\".

He insulted the diver because the diver insulted him first, not because his submarine was rejected. EVERY single person who reads the header only (and let us be honest - the article is so huge that very few actually reads more than the header) is going to believe that the primary reason he insulted the diver is because it was rejected because of deliberate (as is clear from your answer) wording. \u2014 Preceding unsigned comment added by ",

Here is another source on the subject.  https://www.fastcompany.com/90563199/did-elon-musk-steal-tesla-heres-why-the-ceo-is-rebutting-long-time-allegations-on-twitter Besides it states on Teslas own website that he is a co-founder. https://www.tesla.com/elon-musk  \u2014 Preceding unsigned comment added by ",

There are numerous sources that dismiss Musk's claims or name Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla's co-founders.The sources you listed here would be considered primary sources, which are not really acceptable for this kind of thing. A secondary source would outright name Musk as a co-founder and not simply factually repeat the results of a settlement. Even if you did have some secondary sources, in the presence of conflicting sources Wikipedia policy is to look to tertiary sources. Here is what the tertiary source Encyclopedia Britannica says: Tesla, Inc., formerly (2003\u201317) Tesla Motors, American electric-automobile manufacturer. It was founded in 2003 by American entrepreneurs Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning and was named after Serbian American inventor Nikola Tesla. Nowhere does it state that Musk co-founded Tesla.Quote from Wikipedia policy WP:TERTIARY: Reliable tertiary sources can be helpful in providing broad summaries of topics that involve many primary and secondary sources, and may be helpful in evaluating due weight, especially when primary or secondary sources contradict each other.One last thing. This doesn't hold much weight on Wikipedia (since it is self published by Tesla), but it might be helpful for you. In 2010 Tesla publicly stated that Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning are the founders: Tesla Motors was founded in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning to create efficient electric cars for people who love to drive. Later in the article Tesla names Musk a chairman, but not a co-founder.Musk is a major influence on Tesla, but not a co-founder. Maybe we should say that Tesla claims Musk is a co-founder, but not without the WP:BALANCE of conflicting reports, not in the WP:VOICE of Wikipedia, and not without WP:INTEXT attribution. --",

Please respond to the critique i have raised in the Section above. In response to this: it is a disputed matter - and it even says that on the Tesla wikipedia article (under Founders: Disputed). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.#2003\u20132004:_Founding. If we do not change it to Co-founder then there still needs to be edited something to give Elon more credit. Right now it says: \"He joined Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.), an electric vehicle manufacturer, in 2004, the year after it was founded, becoming its product architect that year and its CEO in 2008\".This screams for a rewrite. He accounted for more than 85% of the series A funding (only 7 months after it was incorporated) with US$6.5 million (of a total of US$7.5 million, roughly 85%), thereby owning the majority of the company and becoming chairman of the board. The current version mentions nothing of this - again serving to discredit Elon at every possible place. He has retained majority and the control of Tesla ever since then and owning about 20% as the far largest shareholder. [User:Bomadsen88]  \u2014 Preceding unsigned comment added by ",

This is should be removed asap. Secondly, the next line refers to an article from CNBC which has also shown \"anti Musk\" behaviour in the past when commenting on his companies. When looking at the article the sources are never clear and are always referred to VERy vaguely. \"Multiple AI researchers from different companies\" and \"A large proportion of the community think he\u2019s a negative distraction, said an AI executive with close ties to the community who wished to remain anonymous\". We have no idea who this AI executive is and what motivations he has to put out such a harsh statements on Musk's views on AI - and besides it is a pretty damn serious claim to make that \"a large portion of the communist thinks he's a negative distraction\" without any sort of proof or documentation to support that claim. This entire part should be removed from the article.  2 Remove \"Despite this,\" in the beginning of the second paragraph. The entire sentence reads: \"Despite this, Musk invested in DeepMind, an AI firm, and Vicarious, a company working to improve machine intelligence.\" This comes across as Musk contradicting his own beliefs. This is not true according to his own statements  (source: https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-maureen-dowd-ai-google-deepmind-wargames-2020-7?r=US&IR=T):  \"Musk was an early investor in DeepMind, which sold to Google in 2014 for over $500 million, according to reports. He said in a 2017 interview that he made the move to keep an eye on burgeoning AI developments, not for a return on investment. \"It gave me more visibility into the rate at which things were improving, and I think they're really improving at an accelerating rate, far faster than people realize,\" he said in the 2017 interview. \"Mostly because in everyday life you don't see robots walking around. Maybe your Roomba or something. But Roombas aren't going to take over the world.\" Remove \"despite this\" and explain his reason for investing. Else it once again only serves to - with deliberate wording, discredit Musk.  The sources for these establish that his claims as well as the man himself are often controversial with experts, which anyone would be hardpressed to disagree with. I fail to see why any of this is improper or unsourced. ",

Or when Jim Cramer (the stock analytic) or Sandy Monroe (expert automotive engineer) was very vocal critics on Elon? Until suddenly they acknowledges that the man was right all alone. But I digress: whether we agree or disagree on that is not important - it is not up to you to decide that \"anyone would be hardpressed\" to disagree.

If this sentence should not just outright be removed then there has to be a clarification as to what he says. If not, this is yet again again again again an example of the way this article often tries to discredit Musk in subtle ways wherever possible.  The source clearly states that he actually gives quite a reasonable reply than merely \"dismissing\" it. He answered: \"What, where they cram people in the subway? That doesn\u2019t sound great.\" This should be added or the entire sentence should be removed. 2 In the last part of the section it reads: \"Jarrett Walker, a known public transport expert and consultant from Portland, said that \"Musk's hatred of sharing space with strangers is a luxury (or pathology) that only the rich can afford\", referring to the theory that planning a city around the preferences of a minority yields an outcome that usually does not work for the majority.[316][317][318] Musk responded with \"You're an idiot\", later saying \"Sorry ... Meant to say 'sanctimonious idiot'.\"[319][320] The exchange received a significant amount of media attention and prompted Nobel laureate Paul Krugman to comment on the controversy, saying that \"You're an idiot\" is \"Elon Musk's idea of a cogent argument\".[316][321]\" There are several things that are wrong with this paragraph. First of: this part should be removed: \"referring to the theory that planning a city around the preferences of a minority yields an outcome that usually does not work for the majority\". Why is this explanation necessary? This again again again again again again comes across as a way to justify the tweet (which Musk rightly sees as an offend) in the first place, so Musk's reply looks even more harsh and unjust. This part should be removed as the tweet does not come with any other explanation. Who knows, what if - what if - Elon actually suggests this way of transportation because he actually believes in courses that will make life better for each individual, and not just himself. Also the tweets phrasing: \"Musk's hatred of sharing space with strangers\" is not very nice (i hope we can agree on that), so again who can blame Musk for taking this as an insult?  Second, this part should also be removed: \"and prompted Nobel laureate Paul Krugman to comment on the controversy, saying that \"You're an idiot\" is \"Elon Musk's idea of a cogent argument\".[316][321]\"\". Who does seriously think that this sentence is necessary? Why in gods name is it relevant to hear this totally irrelevant person comment on the matter? Other than again again again again again to discredit Elon wherever possible? This entire sentence should be removed.  I propose that this entire part (or at least the parts i have suggested) be removed. It brings nothing of relevance to Musk's view on public transportation. It starts with an insult from a random person and continues with another insult by another random person. Guys, this is not good enough for a quality article on Wikipedia.  ",

I'm aware of the FAQ at the top of this talk page but editors should be reminded that WP:NPOV explicitly states: \"Neutrality requires that each article or other page in the mainspace fairly represent all significant viewpoints that have been published by reliable sources, in proportion to the prominence of each viewpoint in the published, reliable sources\" As you read through this section, you get one or two sentences of Musk's views, followed by paragraphs of critics on every topic, people as random as it gets (with only one source, without any care for judging the notability or relevance of these statements). For example on the \"COVID-19 pandemic\" section there's one whole paragraph dedicated to him getting called \"Space Karen\" on Twitter for some reason, sourced by \"International Business Times\" and Newsweek (also a property of IBT, both posted in the same day) and \"Evening Standard\", which doesn't even mention \"Space Karen\" anywhere on the article. On the short-selling section, there's absolutely no mention of the record loses of short-sellers of Tesla [7][8][9][10], which you can get countless articles of by Googling \"Elon Musk shortselling\", and there's no mention of the company being the most shorted one [11], which would explain his negative views toward the practice. In the AI section, the writing makes it seem like he's only person in the world that has these views, due to absolutely no positive voices being included, in clear violation of WP:NPOV. For example this VICE article mentions support or same views from Stephen Hawkins, Bill Gates, Max Tegmark (who has recieved the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Science's Gold Medal in 2019 for \"his contributions to our understanding of humanity\u2019s place in the cosmos and the opportunities and risks associated with artificial intelligence.\" There's mentions of several supportive voices here, here, here, here, etc. In this same section regarding his views on simulated reality, there's only one opinion to his statements: \"Harvard physicist Lisa Randall disputes this and has argued the probability of us living in a simulation is \"effectively zero\", the source of this statement is this Fox Business article [12], which mentions support of the idea (as it being possible, not necessarily real) from Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Max Tegmark and Nick Bostrom, yet only this physicist's statement, which is included as almost a footnote, is included, in a blatant case of WP:UNDUE and bad faith editing. On the public transport section, there's a paragraph of criticism from one Jarrett Walker, which includes 3 sources, two of which are the guy's personal blog, and his Twitter This case of POV pushing is immediately more apparent when comparing articles of fellow billionaires like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Bernard Arnault, Steve Ballmer, etc. which all consist of encyclopedic language instead of tabloid-like content throughout. --",

This is a huge problem, and in no way does it hold up to Wikipedias standards. EDIT: Also worth noting is that one of the major contributors to this article is ALSO the creator (and major contributor) of the article behind TESLAQ which is the short sellers of Tesla. TESLAQ in itself lack any noteworthiness of having its own article, and it might therefor be a very clear breach of Wikipedias clear guidelines on conflict of interest. As per the examples listed here and from my own examples above it is very clear that some of the contributors to this article has a reason not to be unbiased and deliberately tries to paint Elon in as bad a light as possible.
