Wikipedia aims to be a general encyclopedia, and so we must be careful not to allow computer-related meanings to hijack the primary meanings of words. ",

There's no official Python the Snake homepage, so this could be why it has a higher PageRank. The snake results are there too, but more fragmented across pages. This is the major fallacy in the argument to me and I'm surprised it hasn't been brought up much. Google simply cannot be used as a guide, at least not in this case. Maybe if we compare the PageRanks of two US president candidates, but an animal like in this case is impossible to compare to a lanugage that has an official homepage, thus boosting its PageRank massively from Google counting inbound links to it. Pretty much any language tutorial will link to the Python home, just as one example. A page about pythons may point to a much broader range of websites. Personally, I wholeheartedly support a redirect to Python the Snake with a note to the disambiguation page on top, possibly with Python the Language given extra attention as a quick link. \u2014 ",

If you look to the Internet for an answer your results will always be skewed towards computer related subjects. Is that fair? I don't think so. For example, according to stats.grok.se, our article on the C programming language is much more popular than our article on the letter C. So, should we change the former to \"C\" and the latter to \"C (letter)\"? Not in my estimation. For the same reason, I don't believe that we should regard the programming language as being the primary usage of \"Python.\" The only difference here is that, for technical (taxonomic) reasons, I believe it would also be unhelpful to use \"Python\" for a snake article. --",
